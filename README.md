# ravine-discord

This is a work in progress! Watch this space! But not too close!
This is parked until I fix the DMC Discord 404 issue (although it shouldn't cause a crash, it needs a bit of a refactor anyway)
EDIT: Now that Saren has brought in changes need to also bring those in (test SPDs), might be a Dee weekend next weekend, uh oh!

Ravine to-do:
* Fix game over handling.
* Change event cards to future tense.
* Use string matching for all operations.
* Offer reduced output options for `!me`.
* Tell the player what they are missing on failed crafts.
*  Have players react for ready up.
* Make crafting material more clear.
* Switch statement for heart(s).
* Healing should assume full hearts if none specified.
* Investigate alternatives to `!me`.
* Do stats!

This is a reminder to swap out the mushroom!
