# ravine-discord

This is a work in progress! Watch this space! But not too close!

Ravine to-do:
* Run git stats over this repo
* Fix game over handling.
* Change event cards to future tense.
* Use string matching for all operations.
* Offer reduced output options for `!me`.
* Tell the player what they are missing on failed crafts.
* Have players react for ready up.
* Make crafting material more clear.
* Switch statement for heart(s).
* Healing should assume full hearts if none specified.
* Investigate alternatives to `!me`.
* Do stats - add persistence first, probably, then track a leaderboard!
* Swap mushroom!
