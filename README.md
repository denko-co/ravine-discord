# ravine-discord

This is a work in progress! Watch this space! But not too close!
This is parked until I fix the DMC Discord 404 issue (although it shouldn't cause a crash, it needs a bit of a refactor anyway)
EDIT: Now that Saren has brought in changes need to also bring those in (test SPDs), might be a Dee weekend, uh oh!

Ravine to-do:
* Finish night effects
* Handle morning madness
* Cover death / win game cases
* Write the code for paralysis :P

There is a note here about single madness but I don't know what it's for, uh oh!
