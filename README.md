# ravine-discord

This is a work in progress! Watch this space! But not too close!
This is parked until I fix the DMC Discord 404 issue (although it shouldn't cause a crash, it needs a bit of a refactor anyway)
EDIT: Now that Saren has brought in changes need to also bring those in (test SPDs), might be a Dee weekend, uh oh!

Ravine to-do:
* Fix game over handling
* Build to do list out of feedback

This is a reminder to swap out the mushroom!
